# DMIT1530 Assignment 2: Blog

*Due Date*: This Assignment is due on the date indicated on GitHub Classroom and/or Moodle. 

*Weight*: 15% of your overall grade.



## Getting Started
Download the .psd wireframe, required fonts, and marking rubric from Moodle. There is a video of the completed site on Moodle too. :)

Clone down a copy of this repository and begin developing locally. Remember to commit your changes and push up your revised files as you work. 


### Getting Started Tips:
1. Either Print out the PSD or get a notebook and write down the following:
    - All the colours used (headings, links, buttons, body text, hovers).
    - All the Heading fonts, sizing and styling.
    - Determine the size of your html images - you will need to resize and optimize them, the images in the PSD are way too big. 
        -   A helpful hint with HTML images is to find where the image is at it's biggest  size (is that mobile, med or large screens), and make it that size - images can always size down but they don't look good sized up.
2. HTML: 
    - Write well structured HTML, then validate it before moving on to your CSS.

3. CSS: 
    - Layout out all your global styles first (there are lot).
    - Working from a top-down structure start with styling your smallest screen first.
    - For media queries sizes to accurately reflect the PSD mockups, look at the size of your artboards.  
    - Validate your work periodically. 

4. Commit your work to GitHub Classroom as you work.

5. Check the Rubric before the final submit to make sure you haven't missed anytihng. 

## Custom Font Hints
You can only define one variant of a font per `@font-face` rule. This means that if you have a medium and a bold weight, you will need two separate files and two rules.

Remember that you will need to use a custom (self-hosted) font, a Google Font, and a system font for this Assignment.

## Typography Hints
Pay attention to the following:
1. font-sizing from small to large screens. 
2. Line-height
3. font-weights
4. style and the positioning of the type (left, center,right, etc.)

## Hover State Hints
Don't neglect your hover states! Make sure that you include the following: 

1. All of links in the header and footer.
2. All buttons &amp; article links in the page.
3. The social media icons in the footer.
